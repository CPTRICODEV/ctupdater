# CTUpdater
This is a node module that can help you update your app with github!

## Usage
Release your app to GitHub releases using a semver tag name for your version.  
This module will go check on GitHub if a new version is available, download it to a temp directory, and start the downloaded executable.

`npm i ctupdater`

```javascript
const ct = require('ctupdater');

ct.checkForUpdate({
	currentVersion: require('./package.json').version,
	repo: 'https://api.github.com/repos/CPTRICODEV/Updater/releases/latest',
	assetMatch: /.+js/i
});

ct.onUpdateAvailable = (version, asset) => {
	console.log(`new version ${version} available!`);
	gau.downloadNewVersion(asset);
};

ct.onNewVersionReadyToInstall = (file) => {
	console.log(`ready to install ${file}`);
	gau.executeUpdate(file);
};
```

### Methods

#### `checkForUpdate(options)`

Starts an update check. This connects to GitHub and looks for new releases.

- `options <object>`
  - `currentVersion <string>` the current version of the running app.
  - `repo <string>` the GitHub api url for the latest version. For example `https://api.github.com/repos/S2-/gitlit/releases/latest`
  - `assetMatch <RegExp>` a regular expression that matches the installer asset. For example to match `gitlit-Setup-2.0.5.exe` it could be `/.+setup.+exe/i`

#### `downloadNewVersion(asset)`

Downloads the new release from GitHub to a temp folder.

- `asset <object>` the asset object received as parameter on the `onUpdateAvailable` event.

#### `executeUpdate(file)`

Executes the downloaded installer for the new version.

- `file <string>` the `file` path received as parameter on the `onNewVersionReadyToInstall` event.

### Events

#### `onUpdateAvailable(version, asset)`

Callback that is invoked when a new version of the app is available on GitHub.  
This event can be used to tell the user that there is a new version available, and ask him if he wants to download it.

- `version <string>` the new remote version that was found.
- `asset <object>` the GitHub asset object for the release.

#### `onNewVersionReadyToInstall(file)`

Callback that is invoked when the new version is downloaded and ready to be installed.  
This event can be used to tell the user that the new version is ready to be installed, and ask him if he wants to go ahead with the installation.

- `file <string>` path of the installer that was downloaded.
